The incident response process provides a structured approach to manage and mitigate security incidents effectively.\n\n**1. NIST Incident Response Phases:**\n- **Preparation:** Strengthen systems and networks to resist attacks.\n- **Detection:** Identify security incidents.\n- **Analysis:** Thoroughly examine and evaluate the incident.\n- **Containment:** Limit incident impact, secure data, protect operations.\n- **Eradication:** Remove malicious activity after containment.\n- **Recovery:** Restore systems and services to secure state.\n- **Lessons Learned:** Document experiences and improve future response.\n\n**2. Reporting and Training:**\n- **After-Action Report:** Collect formalized information about the incident.\n- **Training:** Ensure staff understand processes, priorities, and past incident lessons.\n- **Testing:** Practical exercises to simulate incidents.\n  - Tabletop exercises: simulate incidents in a controlled environment.\n  - Penetration tests: e.g., Metasploit, Cobalt Strike, Kali Linux, ParrotOS, Commando OS.\n  - Simulation scenarios: phishing, ransomware, multi-stage attacks.\n\n**3. Root Cause Analysis:**\n- Define/scope the incident.\n- Determine causal relationships.\n- Identify affected systems and elements.\n- Implement effective solutions.\n- Track solutions and improvements.\n- Use a no-blame approach.\n\n**4. Threat Hunting:**\n- Detect hidden threats not caught by regular monitoring.\n- Establish hypothesis: predict likely high-impact events.\n- Profile threat actors: insider, hacktivist, criminal, nation-state.\n- Identify TTPs (tactics, techniques, procedures).\n- Examine other hosts, create new IPS signatures.\n- Integrate with threat intelligence.\n\n**5. Digital Forensics:**\n- **Identification:** Secure scene and define evidence scope.\n- **Collection:** Gather and preserve physical/digital evidence. (Follow order of volatility: memory → system state → storage → network logs → remote/archived data.)\n- **Chain of Custody:** Document handling of evidence.\n- **Disk Imaging:** Bit-by-bit copy of storage devices.\n- **File Carving:** Extract files without relying on file system.\n- **Analysis:** Scrutinize data for relevant info, timestamps, interactions.\n- **Reporting:** Document findings, processes, methodologies.\n\n**6. Legal Considerations:**\n- **Legal Hold:** Preserve all potentially relevant electronic data.\n- **Acquisition:** Capture and hash system images, follow order of volatility. (Tools: FTK, EnCase.)\n- **Preservation:** Backup copies, isolate critical systems, implement access controls.\n- **E-discovery:** Identify, collect, and produce electronically stored info for legal proceedings.","tags":["Cybersecurity"],"date":"2025-08-12","created":"2025-08-12T00:00:00Z","updated":"2025-08-12T00:00:00Z"},"backlinks":[{"sourceNote":{"id":2,"slug":"comptia-security-plus","title":"CompTIA Security+","content":"### 🛡️ CompTIA Security+ (SY0-701)\n#### 📅 Exam Date: September 7, 2025\n#### ⏳ Study Duration: About 1.5 months\n#### 📄 Study Notes\n[Download Security+ Study Notes PDF](/pdf/CompTIA Security+.pdf)\n\n### ⭐ Why I Pursued Security+\nCompTIA Security+ was my first step into building a strong cybersecurity foundation.
