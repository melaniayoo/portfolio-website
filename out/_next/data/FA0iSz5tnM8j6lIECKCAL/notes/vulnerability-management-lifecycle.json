Identification:**\n  - Systematically detect and categorize weaknesses.\n  - **Methods:** Vulnerability scanning, threat intelligence feeds, penetration testing, static and dynamic code analysis.\n  - **Tools/Examples:** Nessus, OpenVAS, OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, Snyk, Dependabot.\n\n- **2. Analysis:**\n  - Confirm vulnerabilities are real (reduce false positives/negatives).\n  - Prioritize vulnerabilities based on severity, exploitability, and business impact.\n  - **Standards:** CVSS scoring, CVE references, exposure factor calculation, environmental/contextual variables.\n\n- **3. Remediation:**\n  - Implement actions to reduce risk.\n  - **Techniques:** Patching, configuration changes, network segmentation, compensating controls.\n  - Manage exceptions/exemptions with formal approvals if necessary.\n\n- **4. Validation:**\n  - Verify that remediation actions were effective.\n  - **Methods:** Rescanning, auditing, penetration testing, user verification.\n\n- **5.
