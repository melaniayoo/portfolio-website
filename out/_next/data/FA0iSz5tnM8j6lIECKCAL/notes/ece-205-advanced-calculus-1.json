Spend real time thinking about how to understand things deeply and meaningfully.\n\nAlways ask yourself why you're doing something. What kind of life do I want to live after university?\n\nThere will be moments in university when you feel lonely. Don't stay in bed — step outside.\n\nEvery experience and every choice shapes who I am. Don’t be afraid — just try.\n\nWe live in a world of constant change, and we never know when it will shift. If I accept that anything in my life can change unexpectedly, then decisions become less scary. What matters most is having the confidence that whatever happens, I'll adapt and find my way again.\n\n### 🚀 My Approach to Internships\nThere's nothing more certain than actually trying something. Being inside an organization reveals sides of myself I didn't know existed. That's why I shouldn't assume beforehand what I will or won't enjoy.\n\n### 🎯 Reminder to myself\nDon't waste energy debating whether a choice is right or wrong. **Make the choice right by the way you commit to it.**","tags":["University"],"date":"2023-09-01","created":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z","updated":"2023-09-01T00:00:00Z"},"context":"...r Engineers]]\n- [[ECE 204 – Numerical Methods]]\n- [[ECE 205 – Advanced Calculus 1 for Electrical and..."}],"processedContent":"<h3>📚 Concepts</h3><br><br><a class=\"broken-link\">First Order Differential Equations</a><br><br><a class=\"broken-link\">Second Order Differential Equations</a><br><br><a class=\"broken-link\">Laplace Transforms</a><br><br><a class=\"broken-link\">Fourier Series</a><br><br><a class=\"broken-link\">Linear First and Second Order Partial Differential Equations with Constant Coefficients</a>"},"__N_SSG":true}
